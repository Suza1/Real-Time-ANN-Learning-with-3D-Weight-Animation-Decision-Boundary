# Real-Time-ANN-Learning-with-3D-Weight-Animation-Decision-Boundary
An advanced Python-based tool that visualizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learning in real time, including decision boundary evolution, 3D animated weight 
updates (W1 &amp; W2), gradient-colored bars, and live training loss. Perfect for machine learning students, AI educators, and interactive deep learning demos.

# This project animates:
✔ Real-Time Decision Boundary
✔ 3D W1 Weights (with Gradient Coloring)
✔ 3D W2 Weights (with Gradient Coloring)
✔ Live Loss Curve
✔ Rotating 3D Weight Landscape
✔ Make-Moons Classification Dataset
✔ Fully implemented simple MLP (forward + backprop)
